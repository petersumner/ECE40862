Pressing each button triggers an interrupt that sets the state of the code. A separate timer is 
initialized to perform the actions for each state with a period of 500ms. 

Velocity was calculated using the equation: dv = a * dt. The time between each measurement is the 
period of the timer (500ms), which is multiplied by the current acceleration to obtain change in 
velocity over the period. Starting from 0, velocity is updated each period by adding or subtracting
dt depending on the sign of acceleration.

To check if the spinner is in motion, I used an array to store gyro values form the most recent
measurement. Then I found the difference between these and the current gyro value. If the absolute 
value of all three axes is within three degrees of the previous measurement, that is considered to 
be motionless. I chose this threshold because when the board was completely still, the rotational 
values would fluxuate by up to about two degrees. Three ensures that when the board is not rotating, 
the green LED is not accidentally toggled off. 

To check if the board is moving, the current acceleration is compared to 1. If the absolute value of
all three acceleration values is less than 1, then the board is considered to be motionless. I chose 
this value becuase at rest, accleration would fluxuate but mostly remain close to zero.

For the sensors state, the on board LED is initialized as an PWM GPIO output with duty cycle of 512. 
The initial temperature is taken during the initialization state and for each period, the difference 
between this value and the current temperature is calculated. The frequency of the onboard led is 
set to to 10 plus five times the difference.
